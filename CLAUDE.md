# Chatooly Tool Builder - Claude Code Instructions

Welcome to the Chatooly Template! This modular instruction system helps Claude Code efficiently build amazing creative tools while following all the essential rules.

## üìÅ Modular Rule System

This CLAUDE.md file references focused rule modules to optimize token usage and maintainability:

### Core Rules & Structure
- **[01-core-rules.md](claude-rules/01-core-rules.md)** - MANDATORY development rules (canvas structure, CDN scripts, export containers)
- **[02-workflow-setup.md](claude-rules/02-workflow-setup.md)** - Step-by-step workflow when user says "build a tool"

### Technical Implementation
- **[03-canvas-resize.md](claude-rules/03-canvas-resize.md)** - Canvas resize handling and mouse coordinate mapping
- **[04-high-res-export.md](claude-rules/04-high-res-export.md)** - High-resolution export implementation (mandatory)
- **[05-library-selection.md](claude-rules/05-library-selection.md)** - Library selection guide and setup code
- **[08-background-system.md](claude-rules/08-background-system.md)** - Background controls (wire up HTML to backgroundManager API)

### Design & Publishing
- **[06-design-system.md](claude-rules/06-design-system.md)** - Chatooly CSS variables and styling system
- **[07-publishing-troubleshooting.md](claude-rules/07-publishing-troubleshooting.md)** - Publishing workflow and common issue solutions

## üöÄ Quick Start for Claude Code

When a designer says **"Let's build a tool"** or **"I want to create..."**:

### üé® STEP 0: Design Discovery & References (DO THIS FIRST!)

**Before reading technical rules**, ask the designer:
- "Do you have any reference images, design documents, or links to share?"
- "Would you like to create a comprehensive design document first?"

üìã **See [02-workflow-setup.md](claude-rules/02-workflow-setup.md) Step 0.5** for complete design discovery process.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Any design decisions MUST be validated against Chatooly rules. After gathering references, always verify they align with mandatory requirements (canvas structure, export containers, CDN usage, etc.).

### üìñ STEP 1: Read ALL Claude Rules

You MUST read all files in `claude-rules/` directory before starting:
   - `01-core-rules.md` - MANDATORY canvas structure, CDN setup
   - `02-workflow-setup.md` - Step-by-step build process
   - `03-canvas-resize.md` - Canvas resize handling (for interactive tools)
   - `04-high-res-export.md` - Export implementation (MANDATORY)
   - `05-library-selection.md` - Choose the right framework
   - `06-design-system.md` - CSS variables and styling
   - `07-publishing-troubleshooting.md` - Publishing workflow
   - `08-background-system.md` - Background controls wiring (MANDATORY)

### üìã STEP 2: Follow Structured Workflow

1. **Follow Workflow**: Use `claude-rules/02-workflow-setup.md` step-by-step
2. **Validate Design Against Rules**: Cross-check references with Chatooly requirements
3. **Create Comprehensive TodoWrite**: Include design validation tasks
4. **Reference Technical Files**: Re-read specific files during implementation
5. **Continuous Validation**: After EVERY change, verify Chatooly rules compliance

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL VALIDATION POINTS**:
- After gathering design references ‚Üí Validate against Chatooly rules
- After creating comprehensive todo list ‚Üí Ensure all MANDATORY features included
- During implementation ‚Üí Re-validate design decisions align with rules
- After each code change ‚Üí Verify canvas structure, export containers, CDN intact

## üí° Key Benefits of This System

### For Claude Code:
- **Token Efficiency**: Load only relevant rule sections
- **Focused Context**: Each file covers one specific area
- **Better Maintainability**: Update individual rules without affecting others
- **Reduced Errors**: Clear, focused instructions prevent rule conflicts

### For Designers:
- **Consistent Results**: Claude follows the same systematic approach every time
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All technical requirements handled automatically
- **Easy Updates**: Rule improvements can be made to specific areas

## üéØ Example Usage Patterns

```
User: "Build a gradient generator"
‚Üí Claude reads ALL claude-rules files (01-08) FIRST
‚Üí Creates TodoWrite task list
‚Üí Implements tool following all rules:
  ‚Ä¢ Canvas structure (01-core-rules.md)
  ‚Ä¢ Background controls wiring (08-background-system.md)
  ‚Ä¢ High-res export (04-high-res-export.md)
  ‚Ä¢ Canvas resize handling (03-canvas-resize.md)
  ‚Ä¢ CSS styling (06-design-system.md)
‚Üí Re-references specific files during implementation
‚Üí Tests all features work correctly
```

## ‚ö° Ready to Build?

Just tell Claude Code what you want to create! Examples:
- "Build a mandala pattern generator"
- "Create an image glitch effect tool" 
- "Make a data visualization dashboard"
- "Build a color palette generator"

Claude Code will automatically:
‚úÖ Follow all Chatooly rules and standards
‚úÖ Choose the right libraries and setup
‚úÖ Implement proper canvas handling and exports  
‚úÖ Create beautiful, functional tools
‚úÖ Test everything works correctly

**Happy building with Chatooly and Claude Code!**
